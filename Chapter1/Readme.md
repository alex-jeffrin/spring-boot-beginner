## Initializing Spring project

This project is built using IntelliJ Community Edition. The Ultimate Edition of IntelliJ offers built-in support for initializing Spring projects directly when creating a new project. However, since we are using the Community Edition, we will use an online tool to create the project and then import it into our IntelliJ Community Edition.

It will create a default project structure that is ready to use, so you can start implementing your code changes right away without any additional setup.
