## Initializing Spring project

This project is built using IntelliJ Community Edition. The Ultimate Edition of IntelliJ offers built-in support for initializing Spring projects directly when creating a new project. However, since we are using the Community Edition, we will use an online tool to create the project and then import it into our IntelliJ Community Edition.
